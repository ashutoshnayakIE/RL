# Thompson Sampling
Thompson sampling is a bayesian approach to select the next option among a set of options to consider in the next round (in a sequential game where we take actions based on our experience). These problems are also called multi-armed bandit problems. It contains a python jupyter notebook to play with the code as you go through the different concepts.
